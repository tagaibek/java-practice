    The Lucas numbers or series are an integer sequence named after the mathematician François Édouard Anatole Lucas, who studied both that sequence and the closely related Fibonacci numbers. Lucas numbers and Fibonacci numbers form complementary instances of Lucas sequences.
    The sequence of Lucas numbers is: 2, 1, 3, 4, 7, 11, 18, 29, ….
    Expected Output :
    
    First ten Lucas a numbers:

# 8. Write a Java program to find and print the first 10 happy numbers. Go to the editor
    Happy number: Starting with any positive integer, replace the number by the sum of the squares of its digits, and repeat the process until the number equals 1, or it loops endlessly in a cycle which does not include 1.
    Example: 19 is a happy number
    1(2) + 9(2)=82
    8(2) + 2(2)=68
    6(2) + 8(2)=100
    1(2) + 0(2) + 0(2) = 1
    1(2) = 1
    1(2) = 1
    
    Expected Output
    
    First 10 Happy numbers:

# 9. Write a Java program to check whether a given number is a happy number or unhappy number. Go to the editor
    Happy number: Starting with any positive integer, replace the number by the sum of the squares of its digits, and repeat the process until the number equals 1, or it loops endlessly in a cycle which does not include 1.
    An unhappy number is a number that is not happy.
    The first few unhappy numbers are 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 11, 12, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 20.
    
    Expected Output
    
    Input a number: 5
