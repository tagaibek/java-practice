1) read array of char from console
2) read a number from console. The number is the starting position of the new array of char as follows: "enter start position:"
3) read a number from console. The number is the length of the new character array as follows: "enter the length:"
4) create a function which accepts array of characters, start position and length and returns the new array of character
 which corresponds to the given parameters.

 example:
  1)
 a b c d
 enter start position:
 0
 enter the length:
 2
 output >> a b

 2)
 a b c d
 enter start position:
 1
 enter the length:
 1
 output >> b

 3)
 a b c d
 enter start position:
 4
 enter the length:
 1
 output >> -1

 4)
  a b c d
  enter start position:
  3
  enter the length:
  2
  output >> -1

  5)
  b d q s o
  enter start position:
  1
  enter the length:
  3
  output>> d q s
